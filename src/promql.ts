/**
 * In order to handle the PROMQL command we need to solve two problems:
 * 1. Detect when the params section ends and the query starts, so we can apply the promql query embedding.
 *    For this we tokenize the params section with dedicated states, before delegating to the promql query embedding.
 *
 * 2. We need to correctly tokenize ES|QL comments syntax within a promql query.
 *    For this we use the promQLQuery state, which is applied while tokenizing the query content.
 *    It will tell the embedded language when the query ends (when a pipe is found).
 *    And will switch to dedicated states for handling comments.
